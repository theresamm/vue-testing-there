## Question
In App.vue, there are two textboxes, with the id `num1` and `num2` assigned to them. There is a `<div>` with the id `result`. 

There is a computed property named sum that just returns 0.

Do the following:

1. Bind the two textboxes to data properties
2. Add code to the computed property sum so that it will return the total of num1 and num2
3. Display the computed property sum in the div#result element.
