## Question
In App.vue, there's a `<div>` set to height 50px and width 50px. There are three radio buttons, one for the colour red, green and blue. The values for the radio buttons have already been set to the strings `red`, `green` and `blue`  respectively.

Using form-input binding and style binding, allow the user to change the background colour of the `<div>` with the radio buttons.
