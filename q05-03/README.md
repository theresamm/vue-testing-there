In App.vue, there is already a textbox defined for you. There's a `<span>` defined next to the textbox. Complete the following tasks:

If the textbox is empty, the `<span>` should display "Please type in something"
If the textbox has less than 7 characters, the `<span>` should display "Too short"
If the textbox has 8 or more characters, the `<span>` should display "OK"
