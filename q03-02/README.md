# Questions
You are given a box represented as a `<div>`  and three buttons. The buttons are labelled as "red", "green" and "blue" respectively. A `bgcolor` data property has already been added for you inside App.vue

Your tasks are:
1. Add event handlers for each of the buttons. When a button is clicked, change the `bgcolor` data property to the colour associated with the button.
2. Use style binding on the `<div>` such that when the "green" button is clicked, the `<div>`'s background colour changes to the one represented by the button. For example, if the user clicks on the "green" button, the background colour of the `<div>` becomes green.
