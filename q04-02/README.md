You are given an empty App component for this question.

You are to create a component named `AverageNumber`.  Make sure it is in the same directory as `App.vue`.

 Your tasks are to:

1. Create two props in the `AverageNumber` component. Name them as `num1` and `num2`
2. Add code to `AverageNumber` such that it will display the average of `num1` and `num2` within a `<div>` with a id of "results"
3. Create an instance of the `AverageNumber` within the `App` component. Set the `num1` prop of the `AverageNumber` component to 7, and the `num2` prop to 5. The `<div>` inside `AverageNumber` should display the average of the two numbers.
