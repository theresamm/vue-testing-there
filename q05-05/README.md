## Question
In App.vue, there's a `<div>` set to height 50px and width 50px. There is a `<select>` dropdown, one for the colour red, green and blue. The values for each of the options in the `<select>` has already been set to red, green and blue  respectively.

Using form-input binding and style binding, allow the user to change the background colour of the `<div>` with the `<select>` dropdown.
